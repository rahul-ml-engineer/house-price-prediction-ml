# 🏠 House Price Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project builds a **complete machine learning pipeline** to predict house prices using the **Ames Housing Dataset**.

It demonstrates a full **end-to-end ML workflow**, including:

* Data exploration
* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model comparison
* Final model training
* Prediction pipeline
* Deployment using a **Streamlit web application**

The goal is to estimate the **sale price of a house based on property features** such as living area, overall quality, basement size, garage capacity, and more.

---

# 📊 Project Overview

House price prediction is a classic **regression problem in machine learning**.

This project follows real-world ML development practices:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model comparison using cross-validation
* Final model training
* Building a prediction pipeline
* Deploying the model with Streamlit

The final result is an **interactive application that predicts house prices instantly**.

# 🧠 Models Evaluated

The following models were evaluated using **5-fold cross-validation**:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting Regressor

Model performance was compared using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

**Final Model Used:** Linear Regression

---

# 📈 Features Used

The model uses several important house characteristics such as:

* Overall quality of the house
* Living area (square feet)
* Basement size
* Garage capacity
* Year built

Additional **engineered features** were created to improve performance:

* HouseAge
* GarageAge
* RemodAge
* TotalSF
* TotalBathrooms
* TotalPorchSF

Feature engineering significantly improved the model’s predictive power.

# ⚡ Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

## 1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction-ml.git
cd house-price-prediction-ml

## 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment

python -m venv .venv

## 3️⃣ Activate the environment

Windows:

.venv\Scripts\activate

Mac / Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate

## 4️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## 5️⃣ Train the model

python src/train_model.py

## 6️⃣ Run the Streamlit application

streamlit run app/app.py

The application will open in your browser at:

http://localhost:8501

# 🖥 Streamlit Web Application

The Streamlit interface allows users to **input house features and get an estimated price instantly**.

Example inputs include:

* Overall Quality
* Living Area
* Basement Area
* Garage Capacity
* Year Built

The application then predicts the **estimated market value of the property**.
